//! Rate-limit aware adaptive scheduling for sub-agent fan-out ("swarm mode").
//!
//! A swarm can launch an unbounded number of sub-agents against one shared
//! LLM provider, so parallel 429s are the steady state rather than an edge
//! case. This module gives the sub-agent module two cooperating pieces:
//!
//! 1. [`DynamicGate`] — a launch gate with a *dynamically adjustable*
//!    capacity, built directly on `tokio::sync::Semaphore`.
//!    `Semaphore::forget_permits` (stable since tokio 1.37) makes
//!    shrink-below-active possible on the stock primitive: shrinking forgets
//!    free slots while children already holding permits keep running to
//!    completion, and new admissions block until the outstanding count drops
//!    under capacity.
//!
//! 2. [`RateLimitGovernor`] — a sliding-window observer fed by the sub-agent
//!    LLM call path. Every rate-limited attempt and every successful attempt
//!    is reported; when the recent failure count crosses a threshold the
//!    governor shrinks the gate (multiplicative decrease), and under a
//!    sustained burst it pauses new admissions entirely. Sustained success
//!    recovers capacity additively (AIMD), which converges without the
//!    oscillation a symmetric controller would show.
//!
//! Retries themselves stay in the LLM call path (see
//! `request_subagent_model_response_with_retries`): the governor never
//! delays an in-flight call, it only decides whether *new* launches may be
//! admitted. `QuotaExhausted` is deliberately not reported — quota is a
//! billing condition, not a transient throttle, and must keep following the
//! existing fatal/checkpoint path.
