# computer-use

Codewhale Computer Use — the `computer-use` plugin. One tool surface, four
platforms, and **switching between registered computers as a default**: every
tool accepts `computer`, and using a computer id sticks until you switch.

The bundle is an Agent Plugins v1 package (`plugin.json` + sibling `mcp.json`,
`commands/`, `skills/`): the Codewhale Engine discovers, reviews, installs, and
runs it. Nothing here writes to your Codewhale configuration.

| | |
|---|---|
| Platforms | macOS, Windows, Linux (X11 + Wayland), HarmonyOS (hdc devices) |
| Hosts | macOS, Windows, Linux (`when.os`); HarmonyOS is a target device, not a host |
| Transports | local process, ssh + bundled remote agent, hdc |
| Runtime deps | none (Node ≥ 20; platform tools probed at call time) |
| Tools | 38: observe, pointer, keyboard/text, semantic, clipboard, recording, computer registry |

## Frontier ability set

- **Observe & resolve** — `list_apps`, `list_windows`, `list_displays`,
  `switch_display`, `get_app_state` (accessibility/UIA/uitest tree with
  element indices + `state_id`), `screenshot` (display/region, raster-bound
  coordinates), `zoom` (close-up crop of the last raster), `cursor_position`,
  `open_application` (exact-name rule), `request_access` (fail-closed
  permission/capability probe).
- **Pointer** — left/double/triple/right/middle click, move, drag,
  down/up, scroll (4 directions).
- **Keyboard & text** — `type` (unicode), `key` (chords + repeat),
  `hold_key`, `set_value` (semantic, background-safe), `select_text`,
  `perform_action` (element's own actions: AXPress / UIA Invoke / AT-SPI / uitest).
- **Recording** — `recording_start/stop/status` on local and hdc computers
  (see below); `recording_list` also lists the files saved on an ssh computer.
- **Computers** — `computer_list`, `computer_switch`, `computer_register`
  (ssh agent auto-push), `computer_remove`.
- **Safety** — `stop_computer_control` kill switch; permission probes that
  name the missing grant; receipts on every call naming the computer it
  happened on.

## Requirements

Tools and permissions are probed at call time; `request_access` reports what is
missing and every capability **fails closed naming the missing tool or
permission** — it never guesses and never half-acts.

- **macOS** — Accessibility + Screen Recording permission for the terminal
  app that hosts the Engine (System Settings → Privacy & Security).
  python3+pyobjc or cliclick improves cursor reads. ffmpeg optional (mp4 remux).
- **Windows** — PowerShell (built in); ffmpeg for recording.
- **Linux** — X11: xdotool, wmctrl, scrot or imagemagick, xclip; Wayland:
  grim, wtype, ydotool+ydotoold, wl-clipboard, wf-recorder; python3-pyatspi
  for the accessibility tree; ffmpeg for recording on X11.
- **HarmonyOS** — `hdc` on PATH with the device connected
  (`hdc list targets`); ffmpeg on the host for snapshot-series recordings.

## How the four platforms map

| Ability | macOS | Windows | Linux | HarmonyOS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Accessibility tree | AX via System Events (JXA) | UIAutomation | AT-SPI (pyatspi) | `uitest dumpLayout` |
| Raw input | CGEvent (JXA bridge) | user32 SendInput/mouse_event (PowerShell) | xdotool (X11) / ydotool+wtype (Wayland) | `uitest uiInput` |
| Screenshots | `screencapture` | .NET CopyFromScreen | scrot/import (X11), grim (Wayland) | `snapshot_display` |
| Recording | `screencapture -v` → .mov, ffmpeg remux to .mp4 | ffmpeg gdigrab | ffmpeg x11grab / wf-recorder | snapshot-series + ffmpeg mux |
| Clipboard | pbcopy/pbpaste | Get/Set-Clipboard | xclip/xsel, wl-clipboard | fail-closed (not exposed by hdc) |

## Remote computers (ssh)

```json
computer_register { "computer": "winbox", "transport": "ssh", "host": "winbox.lan", "user": "me" }
```

Registration pushes the self-contained agent (`agent.mjs` + `src/`) to
`~/.codewhale-cu/agent/` on the remote over scp, probes the remote platform
through it, and pins the result. Remote calls run
`node agent.mjs <base64 json>` — one JSON receipt line back. Only an
allow-listed tool set executes remotely; arguments travel as data, never as
shell. Requires publickey ssh (BatchMode) and Node ≥ 20 on the remote.

Zoom aiming works over ssh: the server remembers the remote raster, crops
through the agent, and rebinds coordinates to the child raster. The crop file
stays on the remote computer and the plugin has no pull tool — view it only
with out-of-band access (scp from a shell). Recording start/stop/status and
press-and-hold (`left_mouse_down`) do not work over ssh: the one-shot agent
process cannot keep a recorder alive or guarantee a press its release, so
they fail closed (`persistent_session_required`). Press-and-hold additionally
needs a macOS, Windows, or Linux computer: the HarmonyOS backend does not
expose it at all (`left_click_drag` is the closest alternative there).
`recording_list` still lists the files on the remote computer.

## HarmonyOS computers

```json
computer_register { "computer": "pad", "transport": "hdc" }
```

Drives the device over `hdc shell uitest ...` and `snapshot_display`. Element
targets come from `dumpLayout`; input is touch-synthesis (click / swipe /
inputText / keyEvent). Recording is honestly labeled `snapshot-series`
(frame captures muxed on stop) because HarmonyOS exposes no CLI screen
recorder.

## Development

The bundle lives at `plugins/computer-use` in the Codewhale repository and has
no dependencies to install; run its suites from that directory.

```bash
npm test          # unit + protocol tests (no GUI input performed)
npm run smoke     # live end-to-end against this machine (isolated state dirs,
                  # no clicks/typing into your session, no clipboard access)
```

Smoke receipts land in `receipts/` with per-check pass/fail and artifact
paths. Proven levels are separated: local live (this Mac: darwin) > mocked
transport (ssh protocol, harmony backend logic) > code-complete (win32/linux
paths, implemented to their documented tool interfaces but only verifiable on
those platforms).
